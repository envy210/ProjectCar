# Car Cost Analysis Project

This repository contains a Python project that helps users estimate the total cost of ownership for various car models. 

## Features

* Calculates fuel costs based on user-provided mileage and fuel prices.
* Includes car maintenance cost estimates.
* Calculates and sorts total ownership costs over 5 years (adjustable).
* Recommends the most cost-effective options.

## Datasets Used

* **Car Data:** A collection of .csv files containing car prices, tax, mpg, etc. (Describe where you obtained these files or if they are created by you)
* **Maintenance Costs:** [Name of the CSV file] with maintenance costs by brand, model, and year.
* **Fuel Prices:** [Name of the Excel file] with fuel prices and conversion factors.

## How to Run

**Prerequisites**

* Python 3 ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Pip package manager

   pip install -r requirements.txt 
   ```
   (Create a requirements.txt file listing the packages: pandas, numpy, etc.)

3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py 
   ```
   (Replace 'main.py' with the name of your main Python script)

## Usage Notes
