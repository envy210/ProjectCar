# The Challenge

# Adam wants to buy his first car but he doesn't have a lot of
# money and he is looking for the most cost-effective option
# on the market.

# He is thinking long term and considering not only the cost
# of buying the car, but also the cost of using it over the
# course of 5 years.

# Help him decide by creating a list of car brand and models
# with their cost estimates.

# The Data
# The following data is provided. You should be able to complete the challenge using it:
# . A collection of datasets with car prices, their tax cost and mpg (miles per gallon) by the car brand and
# specifications
# . A dataset with car maintenance costs by the brand, model and year
# . A look-up table with petrol and diesel costs and Gallon to Litre conversion

# Outcomes: Easier Version
# Calculate the total estimated cost of buying a car and any costs associated with using it over the course of 5
# years.
# You should assume that the annual mileage of the car will be 8000 miles.
# Display the results for each considered car variation and create recommendations for the cheapest options

import pandas as pd

cmc = pd.read_csv('Car Maintenance Costs.csv')
# If the column in 'cmc' is called 'Model' (with capital 'M'):
cmc = cmc.rename(columns={'Model': 'model','Year':'year'})  # Make them consistent
cmc['model'] = cmc['model'].str.strip().str.lower()

# print(cmc.head())
